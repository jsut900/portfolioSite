        <p> I am a graphic design senior at Umass Dartmouth. 
            Originally born in Massachusetts, I expanded my horizons by 
            attending Pace University in NYC for two years. There I studied film and had a good two years, 
            but the city proved too busy for me, and film was not as fulfilling as I had hoped.
            So I packed up and transferred to Umass Dartmouth where I discovered my passion for graphic design.
            I am working towards becoming a package designer and loving every step of the journey.</p>
