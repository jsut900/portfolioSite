My portfolio site showcases who I am as a person and a designer. The homepage puts you right into the meat of my work. 
I love how the image grid looks, especially with the color coming through only when you hover. I chose to do an image grid because it is also easy to add work to.
I am very proud of how the header came out. I spent a lot of time refining it and adding my personal touch to it.
I love the "neo-tokyo" look and I thought it worked nice as an interesting header. 
Making the backgroudn a gif and making the header text look like a neon sign was not easy but I am glad I went for it and figured out how to do it. 
I really can't believe how much I have learned this semester. I think the site still needs a lot of work, but now that I have a good foundation I am excited to continue to improve this site.
